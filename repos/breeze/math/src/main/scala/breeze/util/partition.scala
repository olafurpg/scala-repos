  * Creates a copy of the array with its elements rearranged in such a way that the value of the element
  * in kth position is in the position it would be in a sorted array. All elements smaller than the kth element
  * are moved before this element and all equal or greater are moved behind it.
  * The ordering of the elements in the two partitions is undefined.
