  * ===Design notes===
  *  - Implementations must be thread-safe.
  *  - Implementations should have very low runtime overhead such that as
  *    many events as possible can be sent here. In particular, object
  *    allocations should be kept to a minimum.
  *  - `event` is expected to be called many orders of magnitude
  *    more frequently than `events`.
