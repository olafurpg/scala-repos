/**
  * An AsyncSemaphore is a traditional semaphore but with asynchronous
  * execution.
  *
  * Grabbing a permit returns a `Future[Permit]`.
  *
  * Basic usage:
  * {{{
  *   val semaphore = new AsyncSemaphore(n)
  *   ...
  *   semaphore.acquireAndRun() {
  *     somethingThatReturnsFutureT()
  *   }
  * }}}
  *
  * Calls to acquire() and acquireAndRun are serialized, and tickets are
  * given out fairly (in order of arrival).
  *
  * @see [[AsyncMutex]] for a mutex version.
