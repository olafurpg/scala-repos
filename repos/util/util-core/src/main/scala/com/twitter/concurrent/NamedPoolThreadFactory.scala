/**
  * A [[java.util.concurrent.ThreadFactory]] which creates threads with a name
  * indicating the pool from which they originated.
  *
  * A new [[java.lang.ThreadGroup]] (named `name`) is created as a sub-group of
  * whichever group to which the thread that created the factory belongs. Each
  * thread created by this factory will be a member of this group and have a
  * unique name including the group name and an monotonically increasing number.
  * The intention of this naming is to ease thread identification in debugging
  * output.
  *
  * For example, a `NamedPoolThreadFactory` with `name="writer"` will create a
  * `ThreadGroup` named "writer" and new threads will be named "writer-1",
  * "writer-2", etc.
  *
  * @param name the name of the new thread group
  * @param makeDaemons determines whether or not this factory will creates
  * daemon threads.
