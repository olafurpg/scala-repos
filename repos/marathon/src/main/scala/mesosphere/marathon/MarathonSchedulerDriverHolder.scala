  * Usually, you would just wire in the driver directly. Unfortunately, the driver can change over the life
  * time of the application. Whenever a process gains leadership, a new driver is created and has to be
  * made available to the already wired dependencies.
  *
  * A better alternative would be to tear down all state/actors when loosing leadership and recreate/rewire
  * everything when gaining leadership. This would require more code changes, though.
