  * This responsibility is in transit:

  * Current state:
  * - all applications are stored as part of the root group in the group repository for every user intended change
  * - all applications are stored again in the app repository, if the deployment of that application starts
  *
  * Future plan:
  * - the applications should be always loaded via the groupManager or groupRepository.
  * - the app repository is used to store versions of the application
  *
  * Until this plan is implemented, please think carefully when to use the app repository!
