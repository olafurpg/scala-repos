/**
  * Wraps a cached implicit `T`.
  *
  * Looking for an implicit `Cached[T]` first triggers a look for an implicit `T`, caches the resulting
  * tree, and returns it immediately and in subsequent look ups for an implicit `Cached[T]`. Thus,
  * subsequent look ups do not trigger looking for an implicit `T`, only returning the instance kept in
  * cache.
  *
  * Beware that if the contexts in which two subsequent look ups are different, so that looking for a
  * `T` in each of them doesn't return the same result, this change would be ignored by caching. Looking
  * for a `Cached[T]` in the first context would put the implicit `T` of this context in cache, and then
  * looking for a `Cached[T]` in the second context would return the former instance from the first
  * context. E.g.
  *
  * {{{
  *   trait TC[T] {
  *     def msg: String
  *   }
  *
  *   object First {
  *     implicit val tc: TC[Int] = new TC[Int] {
  *       val msg = "first"
  *     }
  *
  *     def print() = println(implicitly[TC[Int]].msg)
  *     def printCached() = println(cached[TC[Int]].msg)
  *   }
  *
  *   object Second {
  *     implicit val tc: TC[Int] = new TC[Int] {
  *       val msg = "second"
  *     }
  *
  *     def print() = println(implicitly[TC[Int]].msg)
  *     def printCached() = println(cached[TC[Int]].msg)
  *   }
  *
  *   First.print()
  *   Second.print()
  *   First.printCached()
  *   Second.printCached()
  * }}}
  *
  * would print "first" then "second" (non cached `TC[Int]` instances), then "first" twice (first instance, returned
  * the second time too through the cache).
