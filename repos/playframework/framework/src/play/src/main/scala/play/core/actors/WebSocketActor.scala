     * pill, then the WebSocket will close as a result, but there's no way to cancel the callback being invoked when
     * the WebSocket closes.  So that callback will send a PoisonPill, but that PoisonPill will end up in the dead
     * letter queue because the actor will already be stopped.  So, to prevent that second PoisonPill from being sent,
     * we use this flag.
     *
     * There still is of course a race condition - the client might close the WebSocket at the same time as the child
     * actor decides to close, and then two PoisonPills might still be sent - we can't avoid that.  But this just
     * prevents the double PoisonPill from being a normal thing that happens every time a child initiates shutdown.
