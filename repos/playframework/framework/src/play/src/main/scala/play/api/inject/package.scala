/**
  * Play's runtime dependency injection abstraction.
  *
  * Play's runtime dependency injection support is built on JSR-330, which provides a specification for declaring how
  * dependencies get wired to components.  JSR-330 however does not address how components are provided to or located
  * by a DI container.  Play's API seeks to address this in a DI container agnostic way.
  *
  * The reason for providing this abstraction is so that Play, the modules it provides, and third party modules can all
  * express their bindings in a way that is not specific to any one DI container.
  *
  * Components are bound in the DI container.  Each binding is identified by a [[play.api.inject.BindingKey BindingKey]], which is
  * typically an interface that the component implements, and may be optionally qualified by a JSR-330 qualifier
  * annotation. A binding key is bound to a [[play.api.inject.BindingTarget BindingTarget]], which describes how the implementation
  * of the interface that the binding key represents is constructed or provided.  Bindings may also be scoped using
  * JSR-330 scope annotations.
  *
  * Bindings are provided by instances of [[play.api.inject.Module Module]].
  *
  * Out of the box, Play provides an implementation of this abstraction using Guice.
  *
  * @see The [[play.api.inject.Module Module]] class for information on how to provide bindings.
