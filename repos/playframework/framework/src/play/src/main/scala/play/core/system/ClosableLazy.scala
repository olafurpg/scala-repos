/**
  * Provides functionality like Scala's builtin lazy values, except allows cleanup of
  * the lazily initialized value. The value is lazily initialized when the `get()` method
  * is first called. Later, if the value is no longer needed, it can be cleaned up by
  * calling the `close()` method.
  *
  * Calling `close()` on an uninitialized ClosableLazy will not initialize the value
  * if it is not initialized. A ClosableLazy can be closed multiple times.
  *
  * After being closed, the value cannot be initialized again. ClosableLazy is designed
  * to make it easier to clean up resources when shutting down Play. If resources were able
  * to be reinitialized after closing, then it would be easy to accidentally allocate resources
  * when shutting down. To prevert reinitialization, galling the `get()` method after `close()`
  * will result in an `IllegalStateException`.
  *
  * The performance of this class should be similar to Scala's lazy values. Once initialized,
  * a single read of a volatile value is all that is needed to get the value. If the value is not initialized,
  * then initialization occurs, Initialization is synchronized on the ClosableLazy object.
  *
  * This class exposes `T` as the type of value that is lazily created. Subclasses
  * should implement the `create()` method to create this value. The `create()` method
  * also returns a function that will be called when `close()` is called. This allows
  * any resources associated with the value to be closed.
