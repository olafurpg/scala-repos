import java.lang.ref.WeakReference

/**
  * Creates a wrapper for a function that uses an inline cache to
  * optimize calls to the function. The function's result for a
  * a *single* input will be cached. If the input changes, the
  * function will be called again and its new output will be cached.
  *
  * Even though this function only caches a single value, it can
  * be useful for functions where the input only changes occasionally.
  * Because it only caches a single value, the cached value can
  * be accessed very quickly.
  *
  * This class will improve performance when the function input changes
  * infrequently and the function is somewhat expensive to call.
  * Even when the input changes, this class will still function
  * correctly and return the correct value, although it will be less
  * efficient than an unwrapped function because it will update
  * the cache.
  *
  * The cached input and output will be wrapped by a WeakReference
  * so that they can be garbage collected. This may mean that the
  * cache needs to be repopulated after garbage collection has
  * been run.
  *
  * The function may sometimes be called again for the same input.
  * In the current implementation this happens in order to avoid
  * synchronizing the cached value across threads. It may also
  * happen when the weakly-referenced cache is cleared by the
  * garbage collector.
  *
  * Reference equality is used to compare inputs, for speed and
  * to be conservative.
