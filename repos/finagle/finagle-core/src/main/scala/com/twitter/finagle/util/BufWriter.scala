/**
  * [[BufWriter]]s allow efficient construction of a [[Buf]]. Concatenating
  * [[Buf]]s together is a common pattern for codecs (especially on the encode path),
  * but using the `concat` method on [[Buf]] results in a suboptimal
  * representation. In many cases, a [[BufWriter]] not only allows for a more
  * optimal representation (i.e., sequantial accessible out regions), but also
  * allows  for writes to avoid allocations. What this means in practice is that
  * builders are stateful and keep track of a writer index. Assume that the
  * builder implementations are *not* threadsafe unless otherwise noted.
