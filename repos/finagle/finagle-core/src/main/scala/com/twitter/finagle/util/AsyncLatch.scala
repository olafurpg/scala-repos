  * the execution of functions passed to it may be delayed. That is, because the
  * latch guarantees serial, non-concurrent execution, functions passed to
  * `await` may have to wait until both of the following conditions are met:
  *
  * 1. No other functions are being executed
  * 2. The latch's count is zero
  *
  * Thus, calling [[com.twitter.finagle.util.AsyncLatch#incr]] will cause
  * subsequent functions passed to [[com.twitter.finagle.util.AsyncLatch#await]]
  * to be delayed until the count is decremented to zero. Once the count is zero,
  * functions are executed in the order that they are provided to `await`.
