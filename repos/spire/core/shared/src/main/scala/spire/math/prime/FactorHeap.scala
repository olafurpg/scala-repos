/**
  * Simple heap implementation for storing Factors.
  *
  * The heap can hold at most ~2B items, which means we can't store
  * more than this many prime factors.
  *
  * Note that "fast factors" don't end up in this heap, so the number
  * of primes we can sieve is actaully the max heap size + the number
  * of fast factors.
  *
  * The sieve implementation itself uses a cutoff, so to test primality
  * of numbers <= K, we need to be able to store prime factors up to
  * sqrt(K) in our heap. Since our heap can hold ~2B prime factors,
  * this means the theoretical upper bound on our segmented sieve is
  * (~2Bth prime)^2.
  *
  * In practice the sieve will slow down to the point of not being
  * useful far before we could reach this limit.
