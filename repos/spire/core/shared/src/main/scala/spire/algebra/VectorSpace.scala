/**
  * A vector space is a group `V` that can be multiplied by scalars in `F` that
  * lie in a field. Scalar multiplication must distribute over vector addition
  * (`x *: (v + w) === x *: v + x *: w`) and scalar addition
  * (`(x + y) *: v === x *: v + y *: v`). Scalar multiplication by 1 in `F`
  * is an identity function (`1 *: v === v`). Scalar multiplication is
  * "associative" (`x *: y *: v === (x * y) *: v`).
