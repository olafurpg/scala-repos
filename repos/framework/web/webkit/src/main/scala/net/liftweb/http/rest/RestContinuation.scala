    * block until there's a response.  The parameter is a function
    * that takes a function as it's parameter.  The function is invoked
    * when the calculation response is ready to be rendered:
    * <code class="scala"><pre>
    * RestContinuation.async {

    *     myActor ! DoCalc(123, answer => reply{XmlResponse(<i>{answer}</i>)})

    * <code class="scala"><pre>

    *      reply => for {i <- longCalc(id)} reply(<x>{i}</x>)
    *   }
    * }
    * </pre></code>
    *
    * The body of the function will be executed on a separate thread.
    * When the answer is ready, apply the reply function... the function
    * body will be executed in the scope of the current request (the
    * current session and the current Req object).
