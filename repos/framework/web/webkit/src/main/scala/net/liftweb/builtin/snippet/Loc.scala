/**
  * The Loc snippet is used to render localized content.
  *
  * Lookup resource with the id specified with the locid attribute. Will also try to
  * use the render method or the snippet body as locid if not specified.
  *
  * So these are equivalent:
  * 
  *   <lift:Loc locid="myid"/>
  *   <lift.Loc.myid/>
  *   <lift:Loc>myid</lift:Loc>
  *
  * There's a special case with the "i" method. It will use the text content as the locid, and will
  * replace the child node with the localized content instead of the current element.
  *
  * This is especially useful together with designer friendly snippet markup:
  *
  * <h2 class="lift:Loc.i">Some header</h2>
  *
  * If the locid "Some header" for the current locale is e.g "En overskrift", this will render
  *
  * <h2>En overskrift</h2>
  *
  * If the locid is not found, it will just render
  * 
  * <h2>Some header</h2>
  *
