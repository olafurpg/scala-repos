/**
  * `AsyncRenderComet` facilitates rendering anything that produces a `JsCmd`
  * independently from a page request. All you have to do is create one and
  * send it a `Compute` message with the function that will produce the `JsCmd`.
  * `AsyncRenderComet` will take ownership of the function and run it in
  * a separate thread comet context, sending the results down using a
  * `partialUpdate` when it is done.
  *
  * Note that if you want to run a function that requires the context of the
  * request you're running in, you'll want to use `LiftSession`'s
  * `buildDeferredFunction` method to make sure that when the function is
  * executed in a separate thread, it will retain request context.
  *
  * In general, consider using one of:
  *  - `AsyncRenderComet.asyncRender`.
  *  - The `lazy` snippet.
  *  - The `CanBind` implicits in the `net.liftweb.http` package that allow using
  *    `LAFuture` and Scala `Future` objects as the right-hand-side of a CSS
  *    selector binding.
  *
  * None of these requires explicit use of `buildDeferredFunction`.
