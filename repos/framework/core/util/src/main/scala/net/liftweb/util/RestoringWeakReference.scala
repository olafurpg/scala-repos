import scala.ref.WeakReference

/**
  * `RestoringWeakReference` contains a `scala.ref.WeakReference` that,
  * after it has been nulled out, uses a restorer function to restore the
  * value.  This can be used for data that can afford to be evicted by
  * the garbage collector, but will be needed later. One good example is
  * Lift form callbacks, which may need the value of an object, but where
  * you don't necessarily want to be retaining the object indefinitely
  * while someone is on a page in the face of GC contention.
  *
  * You can use `RestoringWeakReference` in a couple of basic ways:
  *
  * {{{
  *   val ref = RestoringWeakReference(() => User.find(id))
  * }}}
  * In this situation, the `RestoringWeakReference` will immediately call
  * the passed function to provide the starting value for the reference,
  * and then the same function will be used if the reference is evicted.
  *
  * {{{
  *   val ref = RestoringWeakReference(starter, () => User.find(id))
  * }}}
  * Here, starter is an `Option[User]` and `User.find` returns an
  * `Option[User]`. The first parameter will be used to initialize the
  * weak reference, while the function will be used to restore the value
  * if the reference is evicted.
  *
  * {{{
  *   val baseRef = new WeakReference(starter)
  *   val ref = new RestoringWeakReference(baseRef, () => User.find(id))
  * }}}
  * If you already have a `WeakReference` instance, you can instantiate
  * `RestoringWeakReference` directly and pass that reference as the
  * starting value, as well.
  *
  * In all these cases, you use `ref.value` to get a hold of the value.
  * That function will return the value if it is available, and, if not,
  * it will restore the WeakReference and then return the value.
