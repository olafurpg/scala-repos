/**
  * Bridges from Java functions to Scala functions.
  *
  * The implicits defined here allow Scala code to interact seamlessly between
  * the Java function-like interfaces and the Scala function interfaces for
  * various function arities.
  *
  * In particular, there is a pair of implicits for each arity of function from 0
  * to 4. There is one implicit (called `lift`) from the Java function type to
  * the corresponding Scala function type and one (called `drop`) from the Scala
  * function type to the corresponding Java function type.
