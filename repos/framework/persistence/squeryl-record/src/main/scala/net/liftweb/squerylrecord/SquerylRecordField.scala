  * This trait has to be extended for new fields that

  * in squeryl records.
  * 
  * This is necessary because the class of the field's value in the database
  * has to be known for squeryl, and this information is not directly
  * available in BaseField or TypedField.
  *
  * For all standard fields in record, there is a special handling in
  * squeryl-record. That means, for example, that you can create a subclass
  * of StringTypedField without the need to extend this trait.
