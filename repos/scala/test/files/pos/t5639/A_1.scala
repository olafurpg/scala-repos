  // This implicit was being ignored by `isQualifyingImplicit`
  // if the classpath contained a class file for `class Baz`.
  // This is because the package scope contains a speculative

  // before looking inside the class file. (A Java originated
  // classfile results in the class/module symbol pair.)
