/**
  * An actor that will forward all received messages onto actors that
  * have registered to receive messages. Messages wrapped with
  * `Persist` will be held and sent to all new subscribers (to cater
  * for legacy EnsimeEvents that older clients expect to see on
  * startup).
  *
  * To avoid memory leaks, non-restarting Actors should unregister when
  * they stop. Additional register requests for the same actor will
  * result in all Persist messages being sent again.
  *
  * It feels crazy to be writing this because it seems like something
  * that should be in a standard library:
  *
  * 1. the `EventStream` very nearly does what we want but doesn't
  *    retain information about the sender and uses method calls (not
  *    `tell`). NOTE: although undocumented, subscribing to a `trait`
  *    will subscribe to implementations.
  *
  * 2. the `PubSub` requires named subscriptions and requires non-`tell`
  *    boilerplate on both publisher and subscriber side (although has
  *    the advantage of better networked behaviour).
  *
  * 3. neither Akka solution has the concept of the "Persist" message.
