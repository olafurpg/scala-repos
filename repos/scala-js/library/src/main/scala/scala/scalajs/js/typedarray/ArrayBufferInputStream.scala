/** <span class="badge badge-ecma6" style="float: right;">ECMAScript 6</span>
  *  A java.io.InputStream wrapping a JavaScript ArrayBuffer
  *
  *  This class is extremely similar to a ByteArrayInputStream, but
  *  uses ArrayBuffers as the underlying representation. Stream
  *  implementations may special case on this stream for better
  *  performance and access the underlying buffer directly. (They still
  *  need to make sure the internal pointers are properly aligned
  *  though).
  *
  *  This stream has several public members (n.b. [[buffer]], [[offset]],
  *  [[length]] and [[pos]]) in order to allow JavaScript aware applications to
  *  special case on this kind of stream and access the underlying
  *  [[ArrayBuffer]] directly for efficiency. In this case it is the client's
  *  responsibility to synchronize [[pos]], as if the stream were read normally
  *  (if the context in which it is used requires this).
  *
  *  @param buffer Underlying ArrayBuffer
  *  @param offset Offset in bytes in [[buffer]]
  *  @param length Length in bytes in [[buffer]]
