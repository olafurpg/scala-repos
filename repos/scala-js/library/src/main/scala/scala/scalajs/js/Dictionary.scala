/** Dictionary "view" of a JavaScript value.
  *
  *  Using objects as dictionaries (maps from strings to values) through their
  *  properties is a common idiom in JavaScript. This trait lets you treat an
  *  object as such a dictionary, with the familiar API of a Map.
  *
  *  To use it, cast your object, say `x`, into a [[Dictionary]] using
  *  {{{
  *  val xDict = x.asInstanceOf[js.Dictionary[Int]]
  *  }}}
  *  then use it as
  *  {{{
  *  xDict("prop") = 5
  *  println(xDict.get("prop")) // displays Some(5)
  *  xDict -= "prop"            // removes the property "prop"
  *  println(xDict.get("prop")) // displays None
  *  }}}
  *
  *  To enumerate all the keys of a dictionary, use collection methods or
  *  for comprehensions. For example:
  *  {{{
  *  for ((prop, value) <- xDict) {
  *    println(prop + " -> " + value)
  *  }
  *  }}}
  *  Note that this does not enumerate properties in the prototype chain of
  *  `xDict`.
  *
  *  This trait extends [[Any js.Any]] directly, because it is not safe to
  *  call methods of [[Object js.Object]] on it, given that the name of these
  *  methods could be used as keys in the dictionary.
