/** Root of the hierarchy of JavaScript types.
  *
  *  Subtypes of [[Any js.Any]] are JavaScript types, which have different
  *  semantics and guarantees than Scala types (subtypes of [[AnyRef]] and
  *  [[AnyVal]]). Operations on JavaScript types behave as the corresponding
  *  operations in the JavaScript language.
  *
  *  By default, JavaScript types are native: they are facade types to APIs
  *  implemented in JavaScript code. Their implementation is irrelevant and
  *  never emitted. As such, all members must be defined with their
  *  right-hand-side being [[native js.native]]. For forward source
  *  compatibility with the next major version, the class/trait/object itself
  *  should be annotated with [[native @js.native]].
  *
  *  In most cases, you should not directly extend this trait, but rather extend
  *  [[Object js.Object]].
  *
  *  To implement a JavaScript type in Scala.js (therefore non-native), its
  *  declaration must be annotated with
  *  [[annotation.ScalaJSDefined @ScalaJSDefined]]. Scala.js-defined JS types
  *  cannot directly extend native JS traits; and Scala.js-defined JS traits
  *  cannot declare concrete term members.
  *
  *  It is not possible to define traits or classes that inherit both from this
  *  trait and a strict subtype of [[AnyRef]]. In fact, you should think of
  *  [[Any js.Any]] as a third direct subclass of [[scala.Any]], besides
  *  [[scala.AnyRef]] and [[scala.AnyVal]].
  *
  *  See the [[http://www.scala-js.org/doc/js-interoperability.html JavaScript
  *  interoperability guide]] of Scala.js for more details.

  /* identity() is important! It prevents the tail-rec treatment in the absence
   * of SAM treatment.
   *
   * When compiling without SAM treatment, the implicit expansion results in a
   * self-recursive call to the implicit conversion. Without `identity()`, this
   * recursive call is in tail position, and the tailcalls phase will convert
   * it into an infinite loop.
   *
   * With `identity()`, the recursive call is not in tail position. The
   * back-end therefore receives a call to the implicit conversion, *which is
   * a primitive*, and therefore applies its primitive treatment,
   * short-circuiting the infinite recursion.
   *
   * With proper SAM treatment, none of this happens, since there is no
   * implicit materialization of a recursive call in the first place.
