/** Base class for top-level, entry point main objects.
  *
  *  Objects inheriting from [[JSApp]] are automatically exported to JavaScript
  *  under their fully qualified name, and their [[main]] method as well.
  *
  *  [[JSApp]] is typically used to mark the entry point of a Scala.js
  *  application. As such, the sbt plugin also recognizes top-level objects
  *  extending [[JSApp]]. It allows to run their [[main]] method with `sbt run`,
  *  and can also generate a tiny JavaScript launcher snippet executing the
  *  [[main]] method of one specific [[JSApp]] object.
