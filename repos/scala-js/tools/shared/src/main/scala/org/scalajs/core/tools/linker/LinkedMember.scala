  *  Note that the [[version]] is relative to the identity of a LinkedMember.
  *  The definition of identity varies as linked members progress through the
  *  linking pipeline, but it only gets stronger, i.e., if two linked members
  *  are id-different at phase P, then they must also be id-different at phase
  *  P+1. The converse is not true. This guarantees that versions can be used
  *  reliably to determine at phase P+1 whether a linked member coming from
  *  phase P must be reprocessed.
