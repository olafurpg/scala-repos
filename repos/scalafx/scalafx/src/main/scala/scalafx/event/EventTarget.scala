    * not automatically added to the chain, so if it wants to process events,
    * it needs to add an `EventDispatcher` for itself to the chain.

    * In the case the event target is part of some hierarchy, the chain for it
    * is usually built from event dispatchers collected from the root of the
    * hierarchy to the event target.
    * <p>
    * The event dispatch chain is constructed by modifications to the provided
    * initial event dispatch chain. The returned chain should have the initial
    * chain at its end so the dispatchers should be prepended to the initial
    * chain.
    * <p>
    * The caller shouldn't assume that the initial chain remains unchanged nor
    * that the returned value will reference a different chain.
