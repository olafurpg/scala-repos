/** Demo illustrating use of event handler subscription.
  *
  * User can draw rectangles, ellipses, or lines. Shape type is selected by pressing corresponding
  * toggle button. For the sake of simplicity of the demo code, only one instance of shape of each
  * type is used. User draws a shape by pressing and dragging a mouse.
  *
  * Each shape type has its own mouse event handler. Only one handler is used at a time.
  * Handlers are implemented using a simple method `MouseEvent => Unit`. When switching handlers,
  * previous handler, if any, is cancelled using a `Subscription` pattern.
