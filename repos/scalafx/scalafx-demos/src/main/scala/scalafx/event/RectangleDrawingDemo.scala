/** Demo illustrating basic use of `handleEvent(..){...}` construct provided by `EventHandlerDelegate`.
  * Here we will handle mouse events. When user presses and drags the mouse over
  * the central pane a rectangle is drawn. Opposite corners of the rectangle are defined
  * by the points where user pressed the mouse and position of the mouse during dragging.
  *
  * Note that is important to use `import scalafx.Includes._`, without it you may get errors like:
  * {{{
