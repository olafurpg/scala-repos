/**
  * A simpler value of [[Accumulable]] where the result type being accumulated is the same
  * as the types of elements being merged, i.e. variables that are only "added" to through an
  * associative and commutative operation and can therefore be efficiently supported in parallel.
  * They can be used to implement counters (as in MapReduce) or sums. Spark natively supports
  * accumulators of numeric value types, and programmers can add support for new types.
  *
  * An accumulator is created from an initial value `v` by calling [[SparkContext#accumulator]].
  * Tasks running on the cluster can then add to it using the [[Accumulable#+=]] operator.
  * However, they cannot read its value. Only the driver program can read the accumulator's value,
  * using its value method.
  *
  * The interpreter session below shows an accumulator being used to add up the elements of an array:
  *
  * {{{
  * scala> val accum = sc.accumulator(0)
  * accum: spark.Accumulator[Int] = 0
  *
  * scala> sc.parallelize(Array(1, 2, 3, 4)).foreach(x => accum += x)
  * ...
  * 10/09/29 18:41:08 INFO SparkContext: Tasks finished in 0.317106 s
  *
  * scala> accum.value
  * res2: Int = 10
  * }}}
  *
  * @param initialValue initial value of accumulator
  * @param param helper object defining how to add elements of type `T`
  * @param name human-readable name associated with this accumulator
  * @param internal whether this accumulator is used internally within Spark only
  * @param countFailedValues whether to accumulate values from failed tasks
  * @tparam T result type
