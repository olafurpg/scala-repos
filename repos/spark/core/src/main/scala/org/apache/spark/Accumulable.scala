/**
  * A data type that can be accumulated, ie has an commutative and associative "add" operation,
  * but where the result type, `R`, may be different from the element type being added, `T`.
  *
  * You must define how to add data, and how to merge two of these together.  For some data types,
  * such as a counter, these might be the same operation. In that case, you can use the simpler
  * [[org.apache.spark.Accumulator]]. They won't always be the same, though -- e.g., imagine you are
  * accumulating a set. You will add items to the set, and you will union two sets together.
  *
  * All accumulators created on the driver to be used on the executors must be registered with
  * [[Accumulators]]. This is already done automatically for accumulators created by the user.
  * Internal accumulators must be explicitly registered by the caller.
  *
  * Operations are not thread-safe.
  *
  * @param id ID of this accumulator; for internal use only.
  * @param initialValue initial value of accumulator
  * @param param helper object defining how to add elements of type `R` and `T`
  * @param name human-readable name for use in Spark's web UI
  * @param internal if this [[Accumulable]] is internal. Internal [[Accumulable]]s will be reported
  *                 to the driver via heartbeats. For internal [[Accumulable]]s, `R` must be
  *                 thread safe so that they can be reported correctly.
  * @param countFailedValues whether to accumulate values from failed tasks. This is set to true
  *                          for system and time metrics like serialization time or bytes spilled,
  *                          and false for things with absolute values like number of input rows.
  *                          This should be used for internal metrics only.
  * @tparam R the full accumulated data (result type)
  * @tparam T partial data that can be added in
