/**
  * An interface for systems that can collect the results of a streaming query.
  *
  * When new data is produced by a query, a [[Sink]] must be able to transactionally collect the
  * data and update the [[Offset]]. In the case of a failure, the sink will be recreated
  * and must be able to return the [[Offset]] for all of the data that is made durable.
  * This contract allows Spark to process data with exactly-once semantics, even in the case
  * of failures that require the computation to be restarted.

  /**
    * Returns the [[Offset]] for all data that is currently present in the sink, if any. This
    * function will be called by Spark when restarting execution in order to determine at which point

  /**
    * Accepts a new batch of data as well as a [[Offset]] that denotes how far in the input
    * data computation has progressed to.  When computation restarts after a failure, it is important
    * that a [[Sink]] returns the same [[Offset]] as the most recent batch of data that
    * has been persisted durably.  Note that this does not necessarily have to be the
    * [[Offset]] for the most recent batch of data that was given to the sink.  For example,
    * it is valid to buffer data before persisting, as long as the [[Offset]] is stored
    * transactionally as data is eventually persisted.
